# Drosophila_flexible_recall
This is a repository with the data analysis and plotting programs used for the published, eLife paper: Flexible specificity of memory in Drosophila depends on a comparison between choices (https://elifesciences.org/articles/80923).

All analysis scripts were written in Matlab. In general, there is a separate script for each figure in the paper. For an explanation of what operations are performed in each script, see the Methods section of the paper. 

Running the scripts assumes raw data in the form of extracted fluorescence time-series traces or behavior trajectories 
are available at appropriately specified path-variables.
